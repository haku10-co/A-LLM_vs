Abstract
The present work is devoted to studying the background dynamical evolution
of a scalar field in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in maximally symmetric space-
time. This study is useful for giving meaning to the presence of two Gauss-Bonnet
vacua, instead of using the spherically symmetric bubbles of the ”true” vacuum
expand in the ”false” vacuum. The theory admits two possible effective cosmo-
logical constants, which lead to two maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The
first solution corresponds to the dynamics of dark energy. When there is matter,
the second solution describes dark matter. In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we
establish the expression of the topological mass spectrum which depends on the
golden ratio and its inverse. In the Schwarzschild limit, the topological density
correspondsto the standard model radiation energy density. We find the mass loss
rate which gives the evolution of mass over time.
1 Introduction
The observations of the rotation of galaxies and gravitational lenses indicate the pres-
ence of a new mass, called dark matter (DM) hiding in galaxies, which does not interact
with radiation and matter, but can be detected by its gravitational effect. The ΛCDM
model is a cosmological model, parametrized by a cosmological constant Λ associated
with cold dark matter. It is often called the standard Big Bang model because it is the

simplest model that accounts for the properties of the cosmos: the large-scale structure
of the observable universe and the distribution of galaxies, the abundance of light ele-
ments (hydrogen, helium and lithium) and the expansion of the universe. ΛCDM model
assumes that general relativity theory correctly describes gravity on a cosmological scale.
However, theΛCDM model presents several problems, such asthecosmological constant,
fine-tuning problem, and the problem of cosmic coincidence [1]. Recent developments of
non-trivial extension of Lovelock theory, namely Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory
have been proposed [2], providing new insights into the 4-dimensional theory of gravity
[3]. Their idea is that before taking the limit D 4, they multiplied the Gauss-Bonnet
−→
(GB) term by the factor 1/(D 4). The divergent factor 1/(D 4) is canceled by the
− −
vanishing GB contributions, which leads to a theory of gravity with only two dynamical
degrees of freedom, which is in contradiction with Lovelock theorem [4] which describes
the gravity at D 5. However, it was shown in several papers that the idea of the limit
≥
D 4 is not clearly defined, as well as the absence of proper action [5, 6, 7, 8]. It
−→
was explicitly confirmed by a direct product D-dimensional spacetime or by adding a
counter term, before taking the limit D 4, which can be seen as a class of Horndeski
−→
theory [9] but with 2 + 1-dofs. Although the EGB gravity is currently debatable, the
spherically symmetric black hole solution is still meaningful and worthy of study [10].
The 4D symmetrical static and spherical black hole solution in EGB gravity were ob-
tained [11], also, solutions of static and spherically symmetric compact stars [12, 13, 14].
Many researchers have studied the mass-radius profile and the maximum mass in EGB
gravity [15, 16]. Consequently, it is possible to describe the matter inside compact ob-
jects (COs) and the dynamical evolution of the matter at high density and the behavior
of violent events. The Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) gravity [17], are the class of
classical scalar-tensor theories that have second-order EOMs, as a special case the Horn-
deski gravity [18]. The EGB gravity admits two maximally symmetric vacuum solutions
as the Einstein vacuum in α 0, and the Gauss-Bonnet vacuum in α = 0 [19, 20]. Pre-
→ 6
vious studies [21] including the effect of varying the cosmological constant, showed that
the correspondence between ordinary thermodynamic systems and black hole mechanics
would be completed to include a variable cosmological constant. The bubble nucleation
probability depends on the curvature coupling of the Higgs fields, which is a renormal-
izable parameter of the Standard Model (SM) in curved spacetime [22]. In the effective
field theory, the thermal and quantum fluctuations to overcome the barrier are charac-
terized by the decrease of the vacuum. The bubble nucleation in thermal fluctuations
can be described in terms of Euclidean time coordinate by instantons [23]. The action of
the Coleman-de Luccia instanton determines the rate of vacuum decay [24]. The classic
solutions for switching from a false vacuum to a true vacuum are called instantons. We

We begin in section 2 with a discussion of the equation of motion for a coupling between
a scalar field and the model. the chameleon mechanism andthe scalaron mass areinvesti-
gated in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the two branches of solutions for the effective
cosmological constant in a maximally symmetric vacuum. In Section 5, we study the
scalar dark matter in the exterior region of CO by the EsGB and the regions of validity
of the GB functional coupling. In Section 6, we explore the applications for the 4D
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. Finally, the paper ends in Section 7 by summarizing
our main results.

3 Scalaron mass in EsGB gravity
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the relationship between dark matter and
the scalaron mass (i.e. the mass of fields φ) [31]. We will study later the scalaron mass
m which will describe the dark matter. To describe the mass of any scalar field, we use
φ
the Klein-Gordon equation (cid:3)φ = ∂ V (φ). Note that Eq.(2.3) gives the same form as
φ eff
in the last equation. Since in Eq.(2.3), does not depend on φ, in this case, the effective
G
potential is evaluated as follows
V (φ) = V (φ) f (φ) . (3.1)
eff
− G
We notice that the effective potential of the scalaron includes the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. In other words, the Gauss-Bonnet term affects the
potential structure of the scalaron; thus, the scalaron mass depends on the matter’s
contribution. The particles of the field φ come from the fluctuation around the minimum
of the effective potential V (φ). The mass of small fluctuations around φ Eq.(??)

where V (φ ) as a minimum value of the scalaron effective potential V . Also we

shown that scalar fields can explain the abundance of dark matter. The scalaron mass
change according to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor [33]. The minimum of the

It is shown that scalar fields can explain the abundance of dark matter. The scalaron
mass change according to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor [33]. In the large

The scalaron field φ becomes dynamical in the low energy density environment on the
cosmological scale. Since the mass m depends on the matter density ρ, thus, the
φ
scalaron becomes heavy in the high-density region of matter. This feature is called the
chameleon mechanism which is one of the screening mechanism in the modified gravity
[35]. The chameleon mechanisms is defined when the scalaron mass depends on the
environment surrounding the scalaron field. The scalaron φ is regarded as a dynamical
dark matter and can be a dark matter candidate. Similar topics had been researched in
many literatures [35, 36].
4 Maximally symmetric vacuum solutions
Recently, there are several papers which study the Particle production induced by vac-
uumdecay[45]. Followingtheseconcepts, here, wewillinterpret theGauss-Bonnetvacua
by the production of dark matter particles. When gravity is taken into consideration,
5
the vacua are those with maximally symmetric spaces [22]. In the maximally symmetric
space, the scalar curvature of de Sitter space is given by
2D
R = Λ, (4.1)
D 2

where Λ is the cosmological constant. In the case of the positive Λ, we have the de Sitter
solution. In the large limit, we obtain 1/φ = 2D Λ . In 4-dimensional vacuum, the

equation of motion hasa solution that R = Λg , implies that R = 4Λ. The Minkowski

spacetime as the vacuum of the Λ = 0. The singularity problem [37] corresponds to

Let us now comment on the two solutions above. The cosmological constant Λ is

equivalent to that found by [26] which is proportional to the mass of the scalar field

(chameleonic dark matter [33]). If ρ decreases over time, the value of Λ increases to
+
reach Λ . On the other hand, the second branch Λ depends on the matter density. We

−
notice that Λ > 0 and Λ > 0, instead of studying the false vacuum forming inside
+
−
the true vacuum in the bubble geometry [39]. The two roots (Λ ,Λ ) can represent
+
−
two faces of the same true vacuum. In a vacuum (without matter), the chameleon
mechanism will be zero, which corresponds to dark energy. The chameleon mechanism
appears when there is the matter Eq.(3.10), the vacua are those with Λ . The vacuum
−
Λ will be spontaneously produced with ordinary matter fields. The Gauss-Bonnet
−
vacuum becomes a chameleon if there is matter, which solves the problem of the Gauss-
Bonnet vacuum suffering from perturbative ghost instability [19]. This justifies that the
matter has an impact on the vacuum, is that the two vacua are separated by a domain
wall, composed of ordinary matter in the thin wall approximation [39]. In particular,
the large curvature limit 1/φ = R = 4Λ Eq.(4.9), must satisfy Λ = ρ/4M2 and

In limit α 0, one can see that this is equivalent to the original form given by

the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. One can check that for D = 2, the topological term
characterized by a vanishes Lovelock coupling α. The Barrow entropy [59] is a new black

The form the functional f (φ) can take f (φ) = e γφ [60], where γ is a constant, which
−
corresponds to EGB gravity coupled with dilaton that arises as a low-energy limit of
the string theory [61]. Using the same principle as this entropy, we assume that for the
compact object (or black hole) exterior, there is a presence of scalar fields φ, while inside
the compact object is replaced by the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling α as

(increase) of the CO radius and the maximum mass [63]. If α < 0 the solution is still
the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, if α > 0 the solution is the de Sitter (dS) space [62].
We investigate in detail the impact of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the properties of
an anisotropic compact object, such as mass, radius and the factor of compactness.

AdS solution. If α < 0 the solution is still an AdS space, if α > 0 the solution is
a de Sitter (dS) space, [50]. The solutions show that the event horizon is located at
R = M √M2 α, where R = R and R are the event horizon and the Cauchy

the average attraction between particles. Before proceeding further, we note that the
mass M can be interpreted as a chemical enthalpy [51], which is the total energy of the
black hole [52] including both the energy PV and the internal energy E and required to
displace the vacuum energy of its environment. The Hubble horizon mass is connected

7 Conclusion
The coupling between the scalar fieldφ andthe4DEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity action
isstudied. Wehavestudiedthemodeldescribingthecompactstarsin4DEinstein-Gauss-
Bonnet gravity surrounded by scalar dark matter. We have made a comparison between
the star interior and the exterior region. In this case, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling de-
scribes the interior structure of theblack hole, while thecoupling functionf (φ) describes
the black hole exterior region. We have shown that f (φ) = 0 inside the black hole. By
solving the equations of motion based on the chameleon mechanism. We refer to φ as
a chameleon field, since its physical properties, such as its mass, depend sensitively on
the environment. It can be used to demonstrate the relation between the cosmological
constant and the matter density. The Gauss-Bonnet vacuum have a chameleon struc-
ture, and the mass m appears with a small fluctuations. Moreover, we have studied
φ
the vacua in maximally symmetric solutions, and we obtain two branches of solutions,
i.e. there are two such vacua. The first solution corresponds to the dark energy and the
second represents the chameleonic vacua or dark matter. We have found strong mix-
ing between the two vacua, which is presented by the chameleon mechanism. We also
discussed the equation of state parameter in the model of the scalar field φ minimally
coupled to EGB gravity, also in the maximally symmetric space. The percentages of the
14
effective cosmological constants are in good agreement with those of dark matter and
dark energy in the Universe.
We have considered 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We establish the relationship
between a topological mass spectrum and the golden ratio. We have obtained the mass
loss rate, which gives by taking the Friedmann equation of type HR = 1 [70], the evo-
H
lution of the mass over time, and the evaporation Hawking time. For such a choice and
fixed values of Lovelock coupling, we have plotted the mass of PBH versus the Hubble
parameter and time.
